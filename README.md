# COVIDTestCalendarAdder

Colorado School of Mines and also some other places use a website called PrimaryBio to schedule COVID-19 tests. They send you a text message after you schedule it. This app watches for those text messages and adds the appointments to your calendar so you don't forget to go for like, a week, not that I'm speaking from experience or anything.

Assume this link is a cool "Get it on Google Play" button. Also assume it's a link, I haven't actually listed it yet.
